# Home Automation - Basic setup

Now you have the hardware up and ready, we will install some basic services on it. We will create a hypervisor that hosts virtual instances where each instance is like a server itself. All my major home automation software components are set up using virtual instances, either VMs or Container.

This documentation goes through the process of creating all software compontents that are needed to get started. It works best top to bottom and step by step and will take approx. 1-2 hours.

But that is just the beginning, to warm up they say. After the basic setup, you can choose (more or less freely without direct order ) what features you want to add to your smarthome network. If dependencies occure, I hope I will mention that.
