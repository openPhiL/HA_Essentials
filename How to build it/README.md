# How to build it

- Chapter 1 - Hardware Setup - is about the hardware I used
- Chapter 2 - Basic Setup -  is about creating the (virtual) software components that are needed for the home to work in it's basic functions.
- Chapter 3 - Composite Setup - is building on top of the Basic setup and adds optional features and steps that I use, but might be irrelevant for your specific needs. The project works without those "Addons". 
- Chapter 4 - Consumtion Setup - is how you interact with the smart home.
- Chapter 5 - Solutions - contains functions/solutions that are added to the setup to fullfill a defined purpose.
