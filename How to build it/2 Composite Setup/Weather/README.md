## Install the Weather Binding
I use the [Weather](https://www.openhab.org/addons/bindings/weather1/#configuration-example) binding to supply OpenHab with all weather related information. The documentation on openhab.org is complete, I don't have to add something here. 

## Create Graphs for analytics
With the addition of weather items, you can access historical data using the influx historical data that is generated automatically for all openhab items. 
I have attached a Weather Dashboard JSON file.
