## Install the AmazonEchoControl Binding
I use the [AmazonEchoControl](https://www.openhab.org/addons/bindings/amazonechocontrol/#amazon-echo-control-binding) binding to give OpenHab access to my alexa.amazon.com account. It will use that API to control the echos. The documentation on openhab.org is complete, I don't have to add something here.
