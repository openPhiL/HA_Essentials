# Welcome to the OpenHouse project

Welcome to my documentation on how to build a "smart" home automation from scratch. This project is public hoping that it helps anybody progressing their own project around smart home. 

What this project might makes different from other approaches are the following **principles**:
- Documentations on every part of the infrastructure: from hardware, software and networking.
- Smart functions must work offline (without internet)
- Infrastructure is designed to be unbreakable (Let's see how that will work out :D )

The Github project has mostly documentation files. All topics are seperated and structured in folders with the READMEs for the documentation. I tried the wiki, but eventually preferred this approach. 

All my major home automation software components are set up using virtual instances. This allows me to switch underlying hardware without touching the software. In case something breaks, I can restore everything on any kind of replacement hardware (e.g. computer, laptop, server) within minutes. That is peace of mind for me and my familiy. More details on the why is found [here](why_virtualization.md)

Still interested? Cool. Then start [here](../../tree/master/_base%20setup).
