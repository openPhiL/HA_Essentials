# Welcome to the OpenHouse project

Welcome to my documentation on how to build a "smart" home automation from scratch. This project is public, hoping that it helps anybody progressing their own project around smart home. 

What this project might makes different from other approaches are the following **principles**:

- Documentations on every part of the infrastructure: from hardware, software and networking.
- Smart functions must work offline
- Infrastructure is designed to be unbreakable (Let's see how that will work out :D )
- Eventually, OpenSource Software is used

This Github project has mostly documentation files. All topics are seperated and structured in folders with the READMEs for the documentation. I tried the wiki, but eventually preferred this approach. 

About the structure of this Github project. 

## How to build it

- Chapter 1 - Hardware Setup - what Hardware is needed
- Chapter 2 - Basic Setup -  is about creating the (virtual) software components that are needed for the home to work in it's basic functions.
- Chapter 3 - Dependencies Setup - is building on top of the Basic setup and adds optional features and steps that I use, but might be irrelevant for your specific needs. 
- Chapter 4 - Solutions - contains functions/solutions that are added to the setup to fullfill a defined purpose.
